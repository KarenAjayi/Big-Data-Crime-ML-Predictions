# Big Data Analytics for Crime Trend Analysis

## Executive Summary
This project leverages Apache Spark and big data analytics techniques to analyze crime patterns across multiple cities in the UK. The dataset, obtained from data.police.uk, covers reported crime types and locations over a two-year period (2021-2022). The objective is to identify crime trends, seasonal variations, and high-crime areas to support law enforcement decision-making and public safety improvements.

## Business Problem
Understanding crime trends is essential for effective policing and resource allocation. Key challenges include:
- Identifying high-crime periods and locations for proactive law enforcement.
- Recognizing seasonal crime patterns for predictive policing.
- Utilizing big data tools to efficiently process and analyze large crime datasets.

## Methodology
- **Data Acquisition and Cleaning**:
  - Imported and preprocessed UK crime data.
  - Standardized column names and removed missing values.
    
- **Big Data Processing with Spark SQL**:
  - Performed SQL-based queries to analyze crime distribution.
  - Created temporary tables to facilitate structured querying.

- **Data Visualization**:
  - Generated time series plots to detect seasonal crime trends.
  - Mapped high-crime areas using geographical data.

## Technologies & Tools Used
- **Apache Spark & PySpark**: For large-scale data processing.
- **SQL Queries in Spark SQL**: For trend analysis and crime aggregation.
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)**: For data manipulation and visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Used for interactive analysis and reporting.

## Key Findings
- Crime rates increased in 2022 compared to 2021, possibly due to post-pandemic societal adjustments.
- Certain months had significantly higher crime rates, suggesting seasonal crime patterns.
- Geographic analysis identified high-crime locations that require increased surveillance and resource allocation.

## Business Recommendations
- **Enhanced Law Enforcement Strategies**: Allocate more officers and resources to high-crime areas and months.
- **Predictive Policing**: Use historical data patterns to anticipate and prevent future crimes.
- **Real-Time Data Integration**: Implement a live crime-monitoring system to allow rapid response to emerging trends.

## Next Steps
- Develop a real-time crime prediction model using machine learning.
- Expand the analysis to include more geographical regions for broader insights.
- Build a public dashboard to visualize crime statistics and improve transparency.
